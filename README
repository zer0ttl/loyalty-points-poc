Part - I : Setting up the ETH blockchain and contract on your local machine

1. Download ganache from https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases for your OS.

2. Run the ganache application. The RPC server should be running at 127.0.0.1:8545. If it is running on a different port you can change the settings by clicking on the settings icon on the top right side. We will need this RPC server IP address and port at a later stage.

3. Go to http://remix.ethereum.org/ and copy the contents of contract.sol to the online editor.

4. Click on the run tab on right side of the editor and under Environment select Web3 provider. A confirmation alert will pop up, click on OK. You will be asked to enter the Web3 Endpoint in the next screen. Input http://localhost:8545 and click on OK. The online editor should now be connected to the local instance of ETH blockchain running through Ganache.

5. Click on Create. This will deploy the contract to blockchain. Copy the address at which the contract was created and paste it into app.py


Part - II : Setting up the Flask Application

1. Clone the repository in a directory of your choice.
home: $ mkdir poc
home/poc: $ cd poc
home/poc: $ poc git clone https://github.com/zer0ttl/loyalty-points-poc.git

2. Create a virtual environment for the project.
home/poc: virtualenv --python=python3.5 venv

3. Activate the virtual environment for the project.
home/poc: $ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) home/poc: $ python --version
Python 3.5.2

4. Install the dependencies for the poc namely web3 and flask
(venv) home/poc: $ pip3 install web3
(venv) home/poc: $ pip3 install flask

5. Set environment variables for flask application and debug settings
(venv) home/poc: $ export FLASK_APP=app.py
(venv) home/poc: $ export FLASK_DEBUG=True

6. Run the flask application
(venv) home/poc: $ flask run
 * Serving Flask app "app.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!

7. You can now visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the application. If everything went well the front page will show a Block Number.


Part - III : Testing the application and exploring

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/get to get the infromation stored in the blockchain

2. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/set/<NAME>/<AGE> to set the information in the blockchain

3. Checkout BLOCKS, TRANSACTIONS, LOGS tabs of the Ganache application for all the transactions that you have made.
